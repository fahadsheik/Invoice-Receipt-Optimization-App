# 📄 Invoice MCP Demo – Invoice Receipt Optimization using MCP

**Live Demo:** [https://invoiceoptimcp.netlify.app](https://invoiceoptimcp.netlify.app)

---

## 🧾 Overview

This project is a demonstration of a streamlined Invoice Receipt system using **Multi-Channel Processing (MCP)** to optimize a critical step in the **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** business workflow. It shows how businesses can automate the ingestion, validation, and ERP integration of invoices received from multiple sources.

Developed as a web-based application (React Native Web/React), this prototype simulates real-world processing steps to highlight the power of intelligent automation and reduced manual intervention.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📤 **Invoice Upload Simulation**
  - Simulates uploading invoices in multiple formats such as PDF, image, and XML.
  - Automatically displays extracted metadata: Vendor Name, PO Number, Invoice Amount.

- 🔄 **Processing Pipeline Visualization**
  - Interactive interface that simulates the invoice progressing through:
    - Ingestion
    - Validation
    - Duplicate Check
    - ERP Push
  - Each stage visually updates, showing real-time system feedback.

- ⚠️ **Exception Handling Demonstration**
  - Identifies invoices with missing or invalid data.
  - Allows manual simulation of issue resolution and reprocessing of invoices.

- 🧾 **ERP Feed Log**
  - Displays a list of successfully processed invoices.
  - Includes metadata like invoice ID, vendor, and push status.
  - Mimics real ERP feed behavior for demonstration purposes.

## 💡 Project Objective

The goal is to demonstrate a practical and scalable solution for one of the most common and inefficient pain points in enterprise operations — **Invoice Receipt and Processing**. 

By leveraging MCP technology, this app showcases how:
- Multi-format invoice intake can be handled efficiently,
- Errors and exceptions can be flagged early,
- Integration with backend ERP systems can be streamlined.

This is especially useful for organizations dealing with hundreds to thousands of invoices from diverse vendors.
