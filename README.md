# Invoice Receipt Optimization App
 The Invoice MCP Demo app is a React Native prototype designed to showcase the optimization of the Invoice Receipt process in the Procure-to-Pay workflow by leveraging Multi-Channel Processing (MCP) concepts.  This mobile-first app simulates the end-to-end journey of invoices received in various formats, progressing through key stages like data extraction, validation, duplicate detection, and final integration with the ERP system.  Key features include:  Simulated Multi-format Invoice Upload: Users can simulate uploading invoices via images, PDFs, or XML, demonstrating the systemâ€™s flexibility in handling multiple input channels.  Dynamic Processing Pipeline: The app visually tracks invoice processing through critical steps, providing clear status updates from ingestion through to ERP push.  Exception Handling Simulation: Displays flagged invoices with potential issues and allows simulated correction, emphasizing the importance of error resolution in automation workflows.  ERP Feed Log: Presents a comprehensive log of successfully processed invoices, ensuring transparency and auditability.  Designed for practical implementation and easy scaling, this React Native app prototype offers a hands-on demonstration of automating and streamlining invoice receipt workflows, reducing processing time and improving accuracy.
